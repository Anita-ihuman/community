# Software Projects

CHAOSS has three software projects that implement CHAOSS metrics and models. Much of the work on these projects is done asynchronously via GitHub and Slack.

* **GrimoireLab** ([GitHub](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab), [Slack](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C022NPTPC8Z)): This working group connects the GrimoireLab software development with metrics work in other CHAOSS working groups.

* **Augur** ([GitHub](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), [Slack](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C0226ELG6R4)): This working group connects the Augur software development with metrics work in other CHAOSS working groups.

* **Cregit** ([GitHub](https://github.com/cregit)): This group connects the Cregit software development with metrics work in other CHAOSS working groups.
