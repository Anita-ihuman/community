## Contribution Areas 

ðŸ“Œ  There is a [Metric Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=276406255) to keep track of all the metrics that are released, under review, or still in progress.

There are several potential areas that are welcomed and appreciated to contribute to:
- Working on new metrics
- Participate in metrics development
- Involving in metrics review
- Help with metrics release

In the following, we elaborate on each contribution area.

### Working on new metrics

- If you wish to create a new metric that you feel is important for measuring OSS community health, check the [Metric Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=276406255) first to see if the metric is already being discussed or under development.
- There are plenty of metrics in consideration (in red), with very few works achieved.
- If you find a metric you wish to work on in the spreadsheet, we recommend you join the corresponding working group call and raise your thought.
- Create a new google doc for this metric using the [Metric Template](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-resources/templates/metric-template.md) and work on enriching each section.
- The leads of the working group will help you walk through the discussion, revision, review, and release stages of the metric.


### Participate in metrics development
- ðŸªœ Usually, a metric goes through several rounds of discussions on the working group calls, during which all the participants collaborate on the google doc, raise suggestions, then discuss together to resolve them.
- We encourage you to get online and participate in the metric collaborations and discussions.
- You can also raise your suggestions on the google doc offline if the working group call timezone is not friendly for you.


### Involving in metrics review
- ðŸ’¡ Metrics go through a review period of at least 30 days before release, with corresponding issue tickets opening for comments.
- The review period will be promoted through multiple social channels (CHAOSSweekly, Twitter, Slack, etc), donâ€™t hestitate to walk in and leave your comments in the issues!
- Out of the review period, all the released metrics are also open to suggestions and revisions. In such situation, we suggest filing new issues to discuss the changes, or directly submitting PRs for minor revisions.


### Help with metrics release
- ðŸŽˆ Metrics are released continuously, occurring one to two times a year, and may correspond with the dates of a CHAOSScon event.
- We rely on the [MARS project](https://github.com/chaoss/MARS) to automatically genereted the publishing PDF.
- Currently, CHAOSS release two languages of metrics: English and Chinese. Youâ€™re more appreciated to provide i18n and [translate](https://github.com/chaoss/translations) the metrics into a third language!
