#### Project Period 

- Inform when mentoring capacity will be reduced, as early as possible (e.g., family, health, vacation)

#### Post Project Period 

- Inform when mentoring capacity will be reduced, as early as possible (e.g., family, health, vacation)

- Communicate availability and interaction expectations
  - No direct messages from applicants 
  - All questions and answers should be on respective Slack channel 
  - Answers to questions within 24 hours 
  - Use the Slack description to define expectations 
- Reevaluation of all processes prior to posting // making available to applicants. Each program is different and changes every year -- requiring a careful look at the best process for each program. 
  - GitHub 
  - Slack 
  - The Program Website
  - Assign One Person? 
- Inform when mentoring capacity will be reduced, as early as possible (e.g., family, health, vacation)
- Inform when there is an issue with a contributor
  - Lacking communication, activity, visibility (MIA), or progress
  - Participant Agreement violations (e.g., plagiarism, harassment, fraud)
  - A bad fit or stepping down
- Formally evaluate contributor participation
  - Communicate with admin and contributors before failing
- If you are a mentor for a project, involvement in any program is for the life of the program (project development, applicant introduction and question period, selection period, project period, and final evaluation). 


### Responsibilities to  applicants

- Help answer questions from potential applicants before the applications are finalized
- Help and/or teach the contributor how to
  - be a part of your community
  - communicate more effectively and in the open
  - work with your org’s preferred communication channel (IRC, Slack, etc)

  - provide convincing technical argument and constructive discussion
  - be independently motivated and productive
  - solve difficult technical problems
- Keep track of their progress, keep contributors informed as to their status
- Communicate on a regular basis:
  - At least twice a week or better
- Give constructive feedback, be patient, and be respectful
- Establish realistic work objectives and timeline expectations
- Re-evaluate scope with GSoC contributor when significantly ahead of or behind expectations
- Work with devs and community to facilitate acceptance of GSoC contributor work
- Explore the pins, descriptions, and Slack messages to find answers to questions. 

**Review periods**
- Very labor-intensive, requiring active engagement by project members to potential mentees 
- Ultimately result in the selection of mentees for the project

**Criteria on which we should rely on when choosing the winning students**

The Selection procedure should be objective, transparent, flexible, and based upon merit. 
Here are a few criteria that can help out on selection: 
1. Realistic plans for the future.
2. The performance of the work tasks.
3. Listening and communication skills.
4. Respect and patience.
5. A good work ethic and the passion to go with it.
6. The desire to help others in the community. 

## Health and Sustainability Mentoring Metrics
- Number of signups (people that want to join us as mentees)
  - For each mentorship program, we maintain a document every year that asks interested applicants to indicate their interest through a PR. Example
- Number of active mentoring relationships (the frequency of conversations between mentor and mentees) 
- Number of mentoring sessions
- Number of hours mentoring
- Number of actions set/notes taken
- Number of goals set
- Number of goals achieved
- Personal satisfaction score
- How many mentees finished the programs successfully
  - Survey during the final parts of the project to see what worked and what didn’t work 
  - Survey would be run by the program coordinator to help offset bias. 

- Is the mentee integrated into the community? 
- The mentee has taken on responsibilities within the community 
- Mentee contributes to the community after the end of the mentorship project
 
This document will help mentoring organizations to choose the right metrics for the project: https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/project-metrics, especially for the Season of Docs.
