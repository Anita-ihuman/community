# A Quick Start Guide for Newcomers

There are several quick ways designed to meet, greet, encourage, and mentor newcomers to the CHAOSS Project. We recommend you:

### 1. Join the CHAOSS Slack and Discourse
We have a Slack Channel! And so many working group focused channels within it. BUT, we've reserved one ESPECIALLY for newcomers, and our community is highly responsive within it. 
This is the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared_invite/zt-1fah5gu35-5oUQEPT32O2Zt~3MFVNMlw). 
And THIS is the channel within a channel, called [#newcomers](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C0207C3RETX) where you'll be welcomed!  (Type the word _**newbie**_ and see what happens!)
We also have a [Discourse forum](https://chaoss.discourse.group/) where you can introduce yourself and explore some of the conversations going on in the community.

### 2. Attend CHAOSS Office Hours
Every week on **Tuesday**, we have an office hours intended to make it easy for you to ask questions, and find your place in the project with a supportive, experienced CHAOSS maintainer. 

You can join these hours from 9am - 10am (USA Central Time) through zoom channel: https://zoom.us/my/chaoss

### 3. Attend a CHAOSS Monthly Onboarding Call
Every first **Wednesday** of the Month, we run a Welcome to CHAOSS call for newcomers talking about the different working groups and projects in CHAOSS. 

You can join this call from 11am - 12pm (USA Central Time) through our zoom channel: https://zoom.us/my/chaoss.

If you can't make this meeting, you can get an overview of CHAOSS by watching a recording of one of the previous [Onboarding Calls](https://youtu.be/MY960Aj4MWI).

Once you've done these three things, you're ready to start participating more actively in CHAOSS! Visit our [Contributor Path - Participating](https://chaoss.community/kb/contributor-roadmap-participating/) to see some next steps for you.
