# A Quick Start Guide for Newcomers

There are several quick ways designed to meet, greet, encourage, and mentor newcomers to the CHAOSS Project. We recommend you:

### 1. Join the CHAOSS Slack and Discourse
We have a Slack Channel! And so many working group focused channels within it. BUT, we've reserved one ESPECIALLY for newcomers, and our community is highly responsive within it. 
This is the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared_invite/zt-1fah5gu35-5oUQEPT32O2Zt~3MFVNMlw). 
And THIS is the channel within a channel, called [#newcomers](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C0207C3RETX) where you'll be welcomed!  (Type the word _**newbie**_ and see what happens!)
We also have a [Discourse forum](https://chaoss.discourse.group/) where you can introduce yourself and explore some of the conversations going on in the community.

### 2. Attend a weekly CHAOSS Office Hours and the Monthly Onboarding Call
Every week on **Tuesday**, we have an office hours intended to make it easy for you to ask questions, and find your place in the project with a supportive, experienced CHAOSS maintainer. 

You can join these hours from 9am - 10am (USA Central Time) through zoom channel: https://zoom.us/my/chaoss

Also, every first **Wednesday** of the Month, we run a Welcome to CHAOSS call for newcomers talking about the different working groups and projects in CHAOSS. 

You can join this call from 11am - 12pm (USA Central Time) through our zoom channel: https://zoom.us/my/chaoss.

### 3. Attend some weekly CHAOSS Community Meetings
Every Tuesday, the community comes together to discuss anything that pertains to the whole community. This is also the place where we share announcements and news. You can participate or just listen. It's really up to you! 

You can join this call from 11am - 12pm (USA Central Time) through our zoom channel: https://zoom.us/my/chaoss.
