# Content Contribution

We welcome contributions in the form of written blog posts or instructional videos for the CHAOSS community of users and other contributors! 

## Process for Writing for the Blog

1. **Choose a topic.** The Communications Working Group maintains a [spreadsheet of content ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4fCA5r3MUUxdlwTcB34V8gkicWFYU7hm_T2h74EHNM/edit#gid=1398016572) and a calendar of scheduled posts. You can find the list of topics [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4fCA5r3MUUxdlwTcB34V8gkicWFYU7hm_T2h74EHNM/edit#gid=1398016572) 

2. **Let us know what you're working on.** Once you've chosen a topic, you should join the [#wg-communications Slack channel](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C047TTUGGAJ) and let us know what you're working on. One of the working group members will add your blog post to the spreadsheet as "content in progress." 

3. **Write the post within 2 weeks.** Because others might be interested in writing about a similar topic, we ask that you write the post within 2 weeks from when you expressed interest in the Slack channel. You can write the post in a Google Doc.

4. **Share a draft.** The Communications Working Group doesn't expect perfection in a first draft! Feel free to share the draft in the [#wg-communications Slack channel](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C047TTUGGAJ) when you are finished with your draft. We will look at it and make some suggestions for potential edits.

5. **Notify us when it's ready.** Jump in the [#wg-communications Slack channel](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C047TTUGGAJ) once more when the article is ready to be published. We will also need your email address for the next step.

6. **We will create a CHAOSS Wordpress account for you.** You do *not* need to know Wordpress or interact with it in any way. We just need to set you up with an account as an Author, so that we can properly attribute your work and make sure you are listed as the author. 

7. **We will add the article publish date to our spreadsheet and publish the article on your behalf.** We anticipate this will happen within 1-2 weeks of your final draft being finished. We will let you know when it has been published so you can share on your social channels.


## Pointers

We encourage you to keep these things in mind:

- **It doesn't need to be perfect.** We don't expect anyone to have a perfect article right from the beginning. We will work with you to make your article the best it can be!

- **It's ok if English isn't your first language.** We will help polish your article and correct any grammar or spelling issues. No worries at all!

- **You don't have to stick to our list of topics.** If you have an idea for an article and it's not on our list of topics, that's ok! We just want to make sure it fits the following criteria:
  - new and original content not already on our website 
  - relates to CHAOSS, metrics, metrics models, or open source community health

- **It doesn't need to be technical.** We are happy to look at articles of all kinds, so don't worry if your article isn't highly technical in nature.

- **It's helpful if you are familiar with CHAOSS.** While we absolutely encourage newcomers to participate, if you would like to write about something specific to the CHAOSS project, we recommend completing the steps in our [Quickstart Guide](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/) and [Contribution Path - Participate](https://chaoss.community/kb/contributor-roadmap-participating/) documents first.
