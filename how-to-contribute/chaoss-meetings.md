# CHAOSS Meetings

CHAOSS works a lot in meetings via synchronous video calls. With very few exceptions, all of the CHAOSS meetings are:

- Open to everyone!
- Hosted on the [CHAOSS Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/my/chaoss)
- Recorded and posted to our [CHAOSStube](https://www.youtube.com/@CHAOSStube/featured) for transparency

Meetings are often changing, so for a full list of the current CHAOSS meetings, please see the [CHAOSS Calendar](https://chaoss.community/chaoss-calendar/).

### Facilitating a Meeting

Some meetings rotate facilitators, which is a great way to contribute to CHAOSS. If this is something you are interested in, you should be a regular attendee at the meeting, and we have some guidance for [how we facilitate meetings at CHAOSS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCxgKXmvASZ2OQA3Eu9OqlzuFSdPtNZHInJHYr0vF8g/edit#heading=h.tja3hdluerhu).

### After the Meeting

After our meetings, the recording gets posted to CHAOSStube. The procedure we follow is:

1. Update video name
2. Add a description that includes a link to the minutes document
3. Configure thumbnail image to show on YouTube for video ([Export PNG from this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iRLlqSfZK_36S0pqACJ0i32BWbu01aXXLdtU1Op__M/edit#slide=id.p3))
4. Add video to appropriate YouTube playlist
5. Publish video
6. Share in the appropriate Slack channel
