# Teams at CHAOSS
This document will lead you through all the current teams in CHAOSS and whom to contact. Some of the teams have regular meetings, which you can find the meeting times on the [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=j9f60skdd67938kvgl0udgqjqs@group.calendar.google.com).

Expectations: You won't get an action item in the first week. You'll likely have to sit in a few meetings to understand what's going on. Hang out with us. Learn. Contribute.
