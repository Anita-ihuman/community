## How do we make decisions?

The basic decision-making mechanism for CHAOSS is a lazy consensus. Each of the software projects or working groups will try to reach a consensus on their decisions after giving a reasonable opportunity to people contributing to them to express their opinion. In this, we welcome all people to join and contribute to our conversations. 

When the issues under discussion are perceived to be of importance to the whole CHAOSS community, the same process will be carried on at the CHAOSS level, using the general periodic calls and other communication means for discussion. 

If consensus is not reached, the issue may be raised to the [CHAOSS board](https://chaoss.community/about/governing-board/), where consensus and voting may be used to get a final decision on the matter.

In any case, all decisions are subject to the [CHAOSS Charter](../../governance-in-chaoss/project-charter.md).

_Note_: By "lazy consensus" we mean, [as Apache does](http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus) a decision-making policy that assumes general consent if no responses are posted within a defined period. For example, "I'm going to commit this by lazy consensus if no-one objects within the next three days."
