# Contributor Roadmap - Participating

CHAOSS is not comprised of only software, so it's important that you have a feel for all the moving parts of our project. If you've gone through the steps on our [Newcomer Quickstart](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/), you're ready to start participating a little more! That's awesome! 

### 1. Look at the different [teams at CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/kb/teams-at-chaoss/) and the types of contributions they are looking for.
What looks interesting to you?

### 2. Put that meeting on your calendar

### 3. Attend a meeting four times in a row (or [watch some of the recordings](https://www.youtube.com/c/CHAOSStube), if you can't make it in person)
You can listen, you can keep your camera off. We donâ€™t care! 

### 4. Join the associated Slack Channel and just listen during the time period of the four meetings. 
- They are usually named #WG-specific 
- You can also search for a working group in the Channel List.


Action items and contributions often come up during the meeting. Once you've joined a team and attended some meetings, and are more familiar with the goals of the group, you are ready to start contributing!
