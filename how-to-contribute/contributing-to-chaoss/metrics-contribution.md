## Contribution Areas 

ðŸ“Œ  There is a [Metric Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=276406255) to keep track of all the metrics that are released, under review, or still in progress.

ðŸŽˆ  CHAOSS Metrics are released continuously, occurring one to two times a year, and may correspond with the dates of a CHAOSScon event.

ðŸ’¡  Metrics go through a review period of at least 30 days before release, with corresponding issue tickets opening for comments.

Based on the above information, there are several potential areas that are welcomed and appreciated to contribute to:
- Working on new metrics
- Participate in metrics development
- Involving in metrics review
- Help with metrics release

In the following, we elaborate on each contribution area.

### Working on new metrics
