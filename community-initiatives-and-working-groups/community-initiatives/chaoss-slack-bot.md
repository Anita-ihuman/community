# CHAOSS SLACK BOT

## About

The CHAOSS Slack Bot is a slackbot in the CHAOSS Project supporting newcomers and providing them with the information they need to contribute and particpate. 


## Bot Functions

- When a user joins the team, sends a message in a predefined channel asking them to introduce themselves.
- When a user joins the team, sends an interactive message via DM to determine how they intend to contribute and provide the relevant resources.
- When a user types “newbie” in a channel or to the bot directly, sends an interactive message showing ways you can contribute.
- When a user types “outreachy” in a channel or to the bot directly, responds with information about Outreachy.
- Responds when a user says "hello", "hey" or "hi".
- Can send a DM to all users in the workspace, triggered by the message “intro-CHAOSS”.
