## CHAOSS Community Contributions
### About This Document
This document is meant to act as a proxy for contributions that would otherwise not show up as a Pull Request. In an effort to surface, acknowledge, and celebrate these contributions, community contributors are highly encouraged to submit a PR to add details about the contributions they've made. We recognize the imperfections of this system, but it is a starting point. We absolutely welcome feedback on this system, which you can provide by [opening an issue](https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues) here in the CHAOSS Community Repo.
### What Counts as a "Contribution"?
If you are spending a block of time dedicated to CHAOSS, that counts as a "contribution," because we greatly appreciate your time and energy. But, if your contribution is already captured in a PR in a CHAOSS repo or org, it shouldn't be listed here.
