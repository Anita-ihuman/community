# CHAOSS Mission and Goals

## **The CHAOSS Project Mission**

The mission of the Project is to:

1.  produce integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases;

2.  establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and

3.  optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.
