# CHAOSS Brand Style Guide
The complete CHAOSS brand style guide can be found in the [Brand Style Guide Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BZSBa4Ttji95NTPwHcVjcu-CgiuwBezd/edit#slide=id.p10).
This guide aims to summarize the high points regarding the use of the CHAOSS brand.

## Project Name & Logo

#### Project Name
The project name “CHAOSS” should be used in all caps to signify that it is an acronym, meaning Community Health Analytics Open Source Software. In a document, please use the full name “CHAOSS” or “CHAOSS project” in first mention; in subsequent references, you may refer to it as “this collaborative project,” or simply “the project” to avoid redundancy or clumsiness. 

#### Project Logos
The range of colors within the project logo communicates energy and symbolizes diverse perspectives and viewpoints coalescing into a beautiful circle, reflective of the CHAOSS community. The project logo can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/chaoss/community/tree/main/media-and-outreach/logos).

#### Logo usage
Always maintain ample, clear space around the logo to preserve its integrity and visual impact. The clear space ensures the logo can be seen quickly, uncluttered by any other information that surrounds it. The correct amount of space consists of the diameter of the “o” in the logo.
