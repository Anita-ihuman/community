# CHAOSScast

> **This is CHAOSScast,** the CHAOSS Community Podcast where we share use cases and experiences with measuring open source community health. Elevating conversations about metrics, analytics, and software from the Community Health Analytics Open Source Software or short CHAOSS project to where ever you like to listen.

## üë• Key roles and people

This is a CHAOSS Community project and should never rely on one person only.

### Roles

Each role should be occupied by different people each episode.

### Host

The **host** is responsible for the making the initial connection to potential guests, moderation, and recording the podcast. Each episode has exactly one \(1\) host. A host is also a panelist.

1. Georg Link
2. Samantha Venia Logan
3. Sean Goggins
4. Dawn Foster

### Panelists

A **panelist** is responsible for research, asking questions, and adding to the conversation on the podcast. A panelist can be anyone from the CHAOSS community and will be invited based on experience in the topic for a particular episode. In most cases, there will be 2-3 panelists per episode. 
### Guest

A **guest** is invited to participate in the podcast and may or may not be a member of CHAOSS.

We have a [Planning Guests document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWreUwzahWGfn3PIVuKJYJ1fJSmbB5BfbLfyhogjnLY/edit) to keep track of who we want to invite.

### Facilitator

A **facilitator** approves episode topics and assists with the scheduling, confirming podcast dates/times, and acts as a central point of communication for all other roles. This role is typically held by [Dawn Foster](https://github.com/geekygirldawn), but may include other hosts as well.

## ‚úç Strategy

### Name: CHAOSScast

The CHAOSS community [discussed names on the mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/chaoss/2020-March/001205.html). _Aastha Bist's_ suggestion **CHAOSScast** was an instant favorite. We considered longer names that were more descriptive but decided to go with the short CHAOSScast and leave SEO to the description

### Subtitle

The [CHAOSS Community podcast](https://podcast.chaoss.community/) elevates conversations about metrics, analytics, and software for measuring open source community health.

### Description

This podcast fills the gap with open source community metric definitions and software on one side and their use in different contexts on the other side. We invite guests to this podcast to talk about how they use open source community health metrics and software in their own open source communities, companies, or foundations. The panelists are CHAOSS Community members who spent considerable time and effort to understand open source community health and how we can measure it through metrics, analytics and software. The podcast topics should be as relevant to the CHAOSS project as possible.

### Goal

This podcast fills a gap in the CHAOSS community by sharing specific use cases for metrics and exploring how metrics are used in different contexts.

### Audience

Anyone interested in open source community and project metrics, including OSPO managers, community managers, open source maintainers, Linux Foundation employees, community members, DevRel managers, and other data enthusiasts.

### Scope

* \[Include\] Interviews with people who do metrics for their community, project, foundation, or company
* \[Include\] Use cases, metrics that matter in specific industries \(e.g., high regulated environments as banks\)
* \[Include\] coverage of metrics platforms not considered for future integration into CHAOSS only if they have some relevance for CHAOSS
* \[Include\] active calls for experiments and/or data sets for ongoing case studies?
* \[Exclude\] non-OSS markets such as marketing brand communities and corporate social circles
* \[Exclude\] quantitative data metrics not related to communities but having much to do with general measurement including ROASS and Paid ad traffic
* \[Exclude\] developing situations and case studies that are more recent than one month or still ongoing

### Style

A panel of 2-3 CHAOSS members interviews guest\(s\) who have done or used OSS metrics in their specific context. The interview is about the specific use case of the guest.

### Format

Each recording is scheduled for 1.5 hours for a released episode targeting 30-40 minutes. The following is the ideal structure:

* Intro music and intro to CHAOSScast
* Intro of panelists
* Intro of guest\(s\)
* Interview with guest
* Value adds or picks
* Thank You's and outro with music

### Sample interview questions

* Tell us about yourself and your background.
* Tell us about the open source community and project metrics you use.
* How were these metrics decided on to be important?
* What decisions do you make based on these metrics?
* What tools do you use for the metrics?
* Who else sees these metrics and how are the metrics integrated in your workflows?
* "what amazing thing did you do?", "what was the community like before it happened?" "when did you realize something needed to change?" "how did you go about getting the thing done?" "what was the end result?" ‚Äúwhy dos what you did matter to the listener‚Äôs communities?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat advice do you have to make doing the same thing easier?‚Äù
* What are your hopes for CHAOSS in the future? 

## üïô Automation

Documenting any automation configured to date.

Georg Link has an IFTT recipe to:

* If new item in this RSS feed [https://feeds.fireside.fm/chaosscast/rss](https://feeds.fireside.fm/chaosscast/rss)
* Then tweet it from @CHAOSSproj
  * Example tweet: [https://twitter.com/CHAOSSproj/status/1256137855606444032](https://twitter.com/CHAOSSproj/status/1256137855606444032)

## üìñ Procedures

The procedures are for the organizer and facilitator of each episode can be found in the [Issue Template]() in the CHAOSS Community repository. A new issue using this template should be created for each episode.

## üí∞ CHAOSScast sponsorship and revenue

SustainOSS sponsors CHAOSScast and covers the cost of hosting, editing, and show notes. CHAOSScast currently doesn't generate revenue. An idea for the future is to include CHAOSScast as an option along other sponsorship opportunities like CHAOSScon.

## üòé Acknowledgments

**Georg Link** was the key person behind the idea to launch a CHAOSS Community Podcast and the first organizer.

**Matt Broberg** was the second organizer to join the team and helped establish the podcast.

**Justin Dorfman** worked with Georg and Matt B to onboard CHAOSScast to the CodeFund Podcast Network and define the procedures required for scheduling, recording, and publishing episodes.

**Matt Germonprez** and **Dawn Foster** were the first panelists. \([Listen to Epsiode 1](https://podcast.chaoss.community/1)\)

**Paul Bahr** from Peachtree Sound is the editor who makes us all sound awesome.
